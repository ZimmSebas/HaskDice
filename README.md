### To Do

- ~Command structures~
- ~Remodel definitions~
- ~Make a functional Eval~
- ~Decide the return value of eval Command~
- ~Add a monad that keeps the state of variables~
- ~Extend Eval~
- ~Lists vs Multisets~ (Lists wins!)
- ~Should i have a Boolean typed variable system?~ (Nope)
- ~Add basic math operators, along with sign and mod (with corresponding errors control)~
- Make a double-typed variable system (Either?). Add error (type-error variable).
- Check if assign is needed (as a eval issue, not only as a command. Probably, yes). 
- Research if double-typed variable is a issue in parser. 
- Define if everything is valued type or can be collection or integer (and it's fine)
- Decide if IfThenElse checks for empty Collection or checks a boolean operator
- Add most of the commands
- Extend Eval (again)
- Cry because i have to make a Lexer
- Lexer
- Cry again, because i have to make a Parser
- Parser
- Language in general

This DSL, was made as my final proyect for the Programming language analysis subject
