# HaskDice

A DSL of dice rolls made in Haskell

-- Work in progress --


### To Do

- Command structures
- Remodel definitions
- Decide if IfThenElse checks for empty Collection or checks a boolean operator
- Lists vs Multisets
- Extend Eval
- Add a monad that keeps the state of variables
- Add most of the commands
- Extend Eval (again)
- Parser
- Language in general

This DSL, was made as my final proyect for the Programming language analysis subject
